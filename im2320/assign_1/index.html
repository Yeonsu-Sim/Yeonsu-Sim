      <div>I looked around exploring what this web site for and saw a strip design surrounding the whole screen and each section.</div></div>

    <div id="outter_stripe">
      <div><div><h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3></div></div>
      <div>I spend the most time on the `Send me a message` page. Also, I repeated typing something, listening to the sound, and watching the letters apart like sand falling onto the ground. I tried to make a sand mountain.</div></div>
    </div>

    <div id="outter_stripe">
      <div><div><h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3></div></div>
      <div>Clicking something and predicting the next event. Much of my prediction failed though.</div></div>
    </div>

    <div id="outter_stripe">
      <div><div><h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3></div></div>
      <div>Interesting. It makes me spend more time exploring this space and curious about the experiences I'll have.</div></div>
    </div>

    <div id="outter_stripe">
      <div><div><h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3></div></div>
      <div>By making something unpredictable. It makes me keep clicking something and finding the key to catch some event even though any other event doesn't happen actually.</div></div>
    </div>

    <div id="outter_stripe">
      <div><div><h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3></div></div>
      <div>For two to four minutes, it was interesting to make it fun and attractive even though the website has a simple purpose. But as time went by, I wanted to find another event reacting to my actions or a new goal I'd like to achieve because I felt I repeated the same things and then bored.</div></div>
    </div>

    <div id="outter_stripe">
      <div><div><h3>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3></div></div>
      <div>It delivers an interactive experience more charming when it reacts user’s actions unpredictably from the general to the trivial, quite delicately.</div></div>
    </div>

    <div id="outter_stripe">
      <div><div><h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3></div></div>
      <div>It references another website created by the author of the website or a blog that recorded the footprints that he had studied so far with their contacts.</div></div>
    </div>

    <div id="outter_stripe">
      <div><div><h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3></div></div>
      <div>I thought I need to know who created this site for what purpose, and what kind of method was used to achieve that purpose, and thankful for this experience I could have gotten from someone's efforts.</div></div>
    </div>

    <div id="outter_stripe">
      <div><div><h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3></div></div>
      <div>It was a wonderful feeling. I should admirable how much time they would have taken to implement the site. </div></div>
    </div>

    <div id="outter_stripe">
      <div><div><h3>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3></div></div>
      <div>It's when I press the button and there's no response. It was just a button displayed for visual purposes.</div></div>
    </div>

    <div id="outter_stripe">
      <div><div><h3>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3></div></div>
      <div>Ironically, the buttons having no role. I knew the buttons don't have any purpose, but I activated/deactivated all the buttons that are placed in some section to elicit an event.
        I was satisfied with the feeling that I was deeply absorbed in this experience itself when I act like this.</div></div>
