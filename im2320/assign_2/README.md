### üìç The Design Motto

The design of music albulm website is inspired by the movie "Inside Out".
We try to live a happy life, but we can't always be happy. Some days just would be happy, and some days would be infinitely depressed.
Feeling negative emotions doesn't mean one's getting worse. The important thing is to embrace and love yourself at every moment.
It's okay to be depressed, it's okay to be angry.
I hope this music album website helps its users to accept and take care of their feelings with music , loving every moment of themselves.
